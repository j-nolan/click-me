# Click Me
Click Me is a web application that allows people to communicate freely through a shared dashboard.

## Demo
A live demo is available [here](https://clickme.otherwise.ch).

## Deployment
- Clone the content of this directory in a PHP/MySQL environement,
- Import the database structure: `mysql -u username -p database_name < db_structure.sql`,
- Edit the `inc/config.php` file and set the host, username, password and name of the MySQL database.

## Notes
The particularity of this project is that it was build from scratch, without the use of any library. The frontend is purely Vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The backend is a simple PHP/MySQL application running on an Apache server.

It was developed by James Nolan during the summer of 2008 — 8 years ago! —, as a high school side project. The project was revived in 2016 as a demonstration.
